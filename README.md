# Odin Recipes

A (very) simple recipe book project created to demonstrate the basics of `HTML` as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## HTML Concepts Used So Far
1. **Elements**
2. **Tags**
3. **Links**  
   - **Relative Links** —— _Navigating from the homepage to different pages within the same folder._
4. **Images**

This project serves as an introduction to HTML structure and navigation.
